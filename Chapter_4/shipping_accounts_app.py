#You are responsible for writing a program that will simulate logging into a businessâ€™s shipping
#accounts software. Once logged in your program will display the current costs of shipping x
#amount of items. Based on the number of items shipped, the cost to ship each item will vary.
#Once the cost to ship an item is set, your program will calculate the cost of shipping the entire
#order. Upon confirmation of the order, your program will place the order and prepare the
#shipment.
